# CS-300-DSA-Analysis-and-Design

    What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
    In Project One, I wrote pseudocode from which Project Two could be developed and to analyze the time complexity of the various data
    structures that I could have chosen to use in Project Two
    
    How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
    Throughout the weeks leading up to Project One, I designed programs that used vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees to assess
    the processing time of each data structure. Analysis was then performed to determine which data structure I would
    use for Project Two. Understanding how the various data structures work aids in determining which structure can be used in an 
    application to best balance code complexity vs time complexity.
    
    How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
    I relied on the supplied course material, Khan Academy, and Geeks for Geeks for their in-depth explanations of the data structures.

    How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
    These projects have firmly imbedded advanced planning and the use of pseudocode into my software development mindset. Analyzing each 
    data structure for comparison demonstrated the necessity of actively testing the practicality of methods and ideas rather than blindly 
    following the status quo.
    
    How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    Project Two was mostly a copy and paste from one of my previously turned in assignments. That assignment could have been more generic
    in its comments and variable declarations for better modularity which would have required even less modification than it already did.
